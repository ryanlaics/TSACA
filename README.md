## TSACA: Three-Stage Ant Colony Algorithm

### 1. Introduction
This is the support website for the TSACA. The appendix files store the solutions for RCPSP at [PSPLIB](http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html) 


###  2. Experimental results
Following is an example of the output of our algorithm:
```
j3021_1 [0, 0, 12, 0, 5, 15, 25, 12, 43, 5, 26, 33, 31, 2, 25, 26, 35, 51, 35, 54, 31, 41, 43, 57, 57, 60, 51, 72, 71, 66, 74, 84] 84 0.0 3.97
```
**The above result can be explained as follows:**
the name of instance⎵[best solution from our algorithm]⎵duration for this instance⎵deviation from optimum (%)⎵use time(seconds)
